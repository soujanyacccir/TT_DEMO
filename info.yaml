  description:  "Digital design for a 4-bit ALU supporting 8 different operations and built-in 4-bit accumulator register
"      
  language:     "Wokwi" # other examples include SystemVerilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  clock_hz:     2       # Clock frequency in Hz (or 0 if not applicable)

  # How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.
  tiles: "1x1"          # Valid values: 1x1, 1x2, 2x2, 3x2, 4x2, 6x2 or 8x2


# The pinout of your project. Leave unused pins blank. DO NOT delete or add any pins.
pinout:
  # Inputs
    - clock
    - opcode 0th bit
    - opcode 1st bit
    - opcode 2nd bit
    - operand 0th bit
    - operand 1st bit
    - operand 2nd bit
    - operand 3rd bit

  # Outputs
    - accumulator value 0th bit
    - accumulator value 1st bit
    - accumulator value 2nd bit
